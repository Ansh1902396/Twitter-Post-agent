      "# MANTRA Brings Real-World Assets Onchain with Mainnet \n\n# Launch \n\nWe’re thrilled to announce that the highly anticipated launch of the MANTRA Chain Mainnet will be coming in October 2024. As pioneers in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector, this milestone marks a significant step towards bringing traditional finance (TradFi) onchain and provides a new home for MANTRA's native token, $OM. MANTRA Mainnet Features MANTRA is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain offering a comprehensive and customizable suite of tools for developers and institutions to seamlessly tokenize real-world assets. The MANTRA Chain Mainnet will offer several key features, including: Enhanced network resilience and stability: MANTRA’s robust security measures mitigate counterparty risk and ensure a secure and reliable network for users and investors. Institutional-grade Platform: MANTRA’s commitment to strict regulatory compliance provides a trusted environment for institutional investors to deploy capital",
      " onchain and efficiently handle large-scale real-world asset transactions. Global Access to Tokenized Assets: MANTRA enables diverse classes of investors to access traditionally illiquid assets, unlocking the multi-trillion dollar real-world asset economy and expanding the global reach of real-world asset tokenization. Bridging TradFi and DeFi CEO & Co-Founder John Patrick Mullin commented on the launch, stating, \"The launch of our Mainnet marks the culmination of years of work to bring finance onchain. We are thrilled to be at the forefront of bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. By providing on-ramps for tokens and stablecoins with world class stability and reliability, we believe MANTRA Chain will be the leading global destination for businesses and industries to access onchain financing and asset tokenization.\" We will bring more RWA partnerships to the forefront, adding to recent announcements like MANTRA’s partnership with UAE real estate giant MAG to t",
      "okenize US$500 million of real estate. The launch of the MANTRA Chain Mainnet represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of RWA tokenization. We want to thank our Sherpas for their unwavering support on this transformative journey to pave the way for a more inclusive and compliant future for tokenized assets. \n\n\n\n",
      "# MANTRA Chain Unveils its Plans to Bring RWAs to the \n\n# Cosmos Ecosystem \n\nMANTRA, a first of its kind vertically integrated blockchain ecosystem, recently published the Litepaper of its very own blockchain MANTRA Chain where it revealed its plans to bring RWAs to Cosmos. The Cosmos SDK-developed blockchain will set the new standard for regulatory compliant tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Any asset with real-world value such as art, securities or real estate can be easily tradable once it is converted into a digital representation in the form of a token. These tokens can be issued through security token offerings (STOs) and can then be traded on a KYC/AML guarded secondary market such as MANTRA Chain’s decentralized exchange (DEX). \"We recognize the potential of tokenized RWAs to revolutionize the way assets are owned, traded, and managed, and MANTRA Chain is uniquely positioned to service this market. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can unlock new levels of liquidi",
      "ty, transparency, and efficiency that will benefit investors, issuers, and the wider financial ecosystem.\" John Patrick Mullin, CEO & Co-Founder What are Real-World Assets? MANTRA Chain will be one of the first Cosmos appchain solutions to offer perhaps the most unique and fascinating application yet: Tokenization of real-world assets. Tokenizing an asset refers to the act of representing an ownership interest in the real-world asset via a digital token. For instance, a user could hold a tokenized Tesla share and trade it on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Such tokenization brings numerous advantages to users. It allows for increased liquidity of assets that were previously illiquid, partial (fractionalized) ownership of a single asset, reduction of transaction costs, greater transparency and increased accessibility. It also provides a more seamless transfer of ownership, since the entire process is automated by the blockchain that is completely transparent and immutable. Token holders",
      " can also be eligible to receive real yield derived from revenue streams associated with the assetsuch as stock dividends or property rental revenue. What else can I do on MANTRA Chain? MANTRA Chain, which has been designed to be the “chain of regulated digital assets” has several other features outside of RWAs. For example, MANTRA Chain makes creating regulatory compliant products easy, making it particularly attractive to Web3 builders. MANTRA Chain will also allow users to build their products into the Chain and make \n\n\nfull use of the integration with the Chain’s yield engine. Building on the Chain will also provide interoperability, IBC compatible tokens, fast cross-chain transactions and other attractive features. We believe this will allow MANTRA Chain to attract a wide range of developers that value transparency and compliance. MANTRA Chain will consist of numerous other innovative products, such as: \n\n- MANTRA Token Service – a powerful SDK that will allow decentralized entiti",
      "es to create, issue and distribute their native tokens, \n\n- MANTRA Assets – a dApp that will allow businesses to issue security tokens that represent real-world assets, and \n\n- MANTRA DEX – the aforementioned decentralized exchange. To learn more about MANTRA Chain and its features, you can read the litepaper here. About MANTRA Chain MANTRA recognizes that the Cosmos ecosystem lacks a chain that is specifically designed to provide regulatory compliance across a wide range of real-world assets (RWA) and tokenized assets. Given this gap in the current ecosystem, we strongly feel that a “chain of regulated digital assets” will create a forward-thinking protocol that attracts users from diverse backgrounds, many of whom may not be current participants within the crypto space, and who value the importance and safety of regulatory compliance.

      "# MANTRA Incubator Project Showcase: Pyse \n\nHey Sherpas! We’re excited to share another update on the MANTRA Incubator program. We launched the program in April at the Dubai World Trade Center (DWTC) in collaboration with Virtuzone — the UAE’s leading corporate service provider. The MANTRA Incubator program represents a major step forward in our mission of promoting innovation in the real world asset (RWA) tokenization sector, especially in the MENA region. In June, we welcomed three projects into the very first cohort of the program, where they receive ongoing support and mentorship to build robust RWA-focused applications on MANTRA’s scalable, high-performance blockchain infrastructure. Our latest Incubator Project Showcase series will give you a firsthand look into the three Cohort 1 Incubated projects that will be live on MANTRA upon mainnet launch. We’ll delve into each project’s vision, proposed solution, and how they will integrate into the MANTRA ecosystem. And now, we’re intro",
      "ducing the first incubated project in the showcase: Pyse. Pyse is a groundbreaking project that aims to democratize access to climate-focused, environmentally friendly solutions by allowing investors to diversify their portfolios with green assets. By integrating into the MANTRA ecosystem, Pyse will facilitate broader RWA tokenization of green assets within the sustainability space. What Problem Does Pyse Tackle? The fight against climate change demands urgent action and significant financial resources to achieve global net-zero goals. We need a staggering $2.8 trillion between 2024 and 2030 to fund real world assets (RWAs) that offset or remove carbon from our atmosphere. While institutional support for sustainability initiatives is growing, there’s a critical gap in grassroots project-level financing. This is where Pyse, a MANTRAincubated project steps in; garnering investment support for climate-based solutions to promote their widespread adoption. Pyse’s Proposed Solution Pyse goes",
      " beyond traditional models, offering innovative solutions for both individuals and organizations: Pyse enables individuals to invest directly in green assets like electric mobility and renewable energy. This ensures these technologies are deployed to help organizations transition to sustainable power and mobility alternatives, allowing investors to offset their carbon footprint and earn predictable returns. \n\n\nWhat Market Gaps Are They Filling? Pyse prioritizes security and responsible investment. The team boasts over 10 years of experience and utilizes a robust credit risk matrix, analyzing over 120 data points to manage project risk effectively. This meticulous approach ensures secure tokenized investments in easy-to-invest instruments. Pyse offers organizations of all sizes “zero-investment leasing” options. This allows them to adopt sustainable practices, like utilizing electric vehicles (EVs) for logistics or switching to solar power for cleaner and cheaper energy, without the upf",
      "ront hardware investment burden. Retail investors and institutions can partake in the green revolution by investing in tangible RWAs backed by secure contracts. These investments create a visible environmental impact and generate a new source of passive monthly income. And yet, Pyse takes it a step further; investors are empowered to positively impact the environment by leveraging the platform’s dashboard to track their carbon footprint associated with daily activities on platforms like Uber and Amazon. With this valuable insight, they can auto-invest their idle stablecoins into green projects, offsetting their emissions while earning returns. Furthermore, unlike marketplaces with unvetted listings, Pyse takes a direct approach. All projects are meticulously vetted, executed, operated, and maintained in-house by Pyse, guaranteeing the quality and viability of each green asset offered. Pyse also houses its EV OEM, designing and deploying custom electric motorcycles tailored for last-mil",
      "e delivery projects in GCC. What Is the Project’s Vision? Pyse’s vision extends beyond individual investments. The platform empowers individuals to manage and offset their carbon footprint while earning returns. This holistic approach aims to promote environmental responsibility and help individuals diversify their portfolios across multiple green asset classes. For businesses, Pyse seeks to be the one-stop shop for transitioning non-sustainable utilities across various sectors, including power, water, mobility, and air. Why MANTRA? For Pyse, exponential growth comes from leveraging our strengths and filling capability gaps through strategic partnerships. MANTRA’s focus on regulatory compliance and a KYC-first ecosystem will enable Pyse to freely innovate and create new green investment products while relying on us for their compliant and scalable distribution. Real-world assets generate real-world yields, often differing from typical Web3 \n\n\ninvestor expectations. MANTRA is deeply com",
      "mitted to educating investors about new asset classes. We will offer necessary guidance on onboarding new users and bringing essential liquidity to the RWA ecosystem. The Pyse team brings a wealth of collective experience, boasting over 35 years of combined experience in the green sector. They have a proven track record of raising funds from Indian retail investors specifically for green investments on the platform. Since its launch, Pyse has maintained a zero-default record on monthly returns from projects on the platform. MANTRA’s RWA-first L1 ecosystem spotlights a space often overshadowed by all-in-one chains. We’re thrilled to collaborate with Pyse to bring onchain an asset class that’s good for the planet and great for the wallet. Pyse is poised to redefine how we finance climate solutions by harnessing the power of RWA tokenization using MANTRA’s scalable infrastructure. The MANTRA ecosystem is proud to support Pyse’s mission to create a more sustainable future for all. ********",

      "# Throwback Thursday: A Recap of Recent Events \n\nMANTRA is poised to become the first RWA L1 Chain, progress that the team has been working towards for the past 18 months, transforming the landscape of real-world asset tokenization. This article looks back at all the events and achievements that led to the Hongbai Testnet. A Major Announcement In July 2023, MANTRA Chain released its litepaper which unveiled its plans to focus on building the necessary infrastructure for compliant RWA tokenization. It included details of the different modules that would allow developers and institutions to tokenize any RWA while streamlining the necessary regulatory requirements involved. This announcement caught the attention of notable publications including Binance Research that put MANTRA at the forefront of RWA-focussed Layer 1 blockchains to watch. Opening The Floodgates When validator onboarding opened in September 2023, a flood of 2000+ eager validators signed up in hopes of participating in the",
      " testnet. Testnet Phase 1 went live on 8 November 2023 with a geographical spread of over 90 validators who helped test chain connectivity, uptime and block propagation. Over the course of several months validators completed various challenges designed to test the chain’s functionality and resilience. Following The People’s Mandate In January 2024, the community spoke overwhelmingly, supporting a proposal to make the OM token the native L1 coin for MANTRA Chain. The team then went on to conduct a feasibility study to see what it would take to replace the planned AUM token with the existing OM token. A few weeks later, the MANTRA team released a proposal outlining how to make OM the L1 token of MANTRA chain which passed with 99.63% in favor. The Road Ahead The recently passed proposal supports four significant updates to the OM token: \n\n- Upgrading $OM: Establishment of a PoS bridge, which will enable bridging the $OM token onto the Cosmos interchain, hence facilitating a smooth transfe",
      "r process of the EVM-based $OM staked tokens onto MANTRA Chain mainnet once it goes live later this year. \n\n- New Reward Mechanism for EVM Staking: Regular snapshots leading up to the mainnet, upon which existing $OM stakers will be rewarded with up to a 1.35x multiplier, \n\n\ndepending on the amount staked and duration. \n\n- Issuance of new $OM: As part of becoming an L1 chain token, new OM will be issued and distributed to the validators.Per block issuance of additional OM will allow for new PoS economics and enable a validator ecosystem that will secure MANTRA Chain. \n\n- Total New Supply: Increase supply by 888,888,888 $OM- largest share of the new tokens (35%) will be allocated as rewards for existing $OM stakers. 34% will go to the ecosystem, 25% for the MANTRA Association and future initiatives, while 6% will be reserved for MANTRA’s Chain genesis airdrop and incentivized testnet. Although the community’s proposition to establish OM as the L1 token of the MANTRA Chain came with its ",
      "own set of challenges, we acknowledged the enthusiasm and support it had garnered, and are fully dedicated to transforming this vision into a tangible reality. Hongbai Testnet We are now gearing up for Hongbai Testnet where we will integrate the latest updates to $OM into our blockchain economics. This next chapter will allow the community to dive into the chain’s capabilities and experience firsthand its potential to revolutionize the landscape of real-world asset tokenization. Get ready to explore and reshape the very fabric of our financial landscape. \n\n\n",

This is done through the redelegation process, where you choose a new validator and input the amount you want to move. Cooldown period After you redelegate your coins, the new validator is subject to a cooldown period during which your coins staked in that validator cannot be redelegated again.

Before heading on to it, please ensure that the dev environment is setup and it's either configured with Node.js REPL or the wasmd Go CLI before you proceed. In this example, we will be utilizing example smart contract code from InterWasm DAO. InterWasm DAO is the organization for CosmWasm ecosystem development. Let's clone the repository in which we keep cw-contracts and compile the existing code for a simple nameservice contract that mimics a name service marketplace. First, clone the repo and try to build the wasm bundle: The compilation should output the file as target/wasm32-unknownunknown/release/cw_nameservice.wasm. With a quick ls lh you can see that the file size is around 1.8 MB. This is a release build but still contains some unused code. To create a much smaller version, you can run the following command which tells",
      " the compiler to strip the unused parts of the code out: This generates a file approximately 165 kB in size. We can either use the command above or apply a different Rust optimizer—details of which will be covered in the optimized compilation # Download the repository git clone <https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts> cd cw-contracts git checkout main cd contracts/nameservice # compile the wasm contract with stable toolchain rustup default stable cargo wasm RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm \n\n## Compiling and Testing the Contract Code \n\n MANTRA Chain Search...^ Ctrl^ +^ K This site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.

It is the smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos Ecosystem and is the principal means by which Developers are able build, deploy and execute smart contracts on MANTRA Chain. 🦀 Rust CosmWasm Smart Contracts are written in a language called Rust. The Rust language is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, particularly safe concurrency. It is syntactically similar to C\u0000\u0000, but is designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance. Key features of Rust include: \n\n## • Memory^ Safety:^ Rust's^ ownership^ system,^ with^ its^ rules^ of^ borrowing,^ lifetimes,^ and \n\n mutability, ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector. This prevents common bugs such as null or dangling pointers and buffer overflows. \n\n## • Concurrency^ Without^ Data^ Races:^ Ru",

The testnet is mirroring mainnet behavior and ensures that developers can identify and resolve issues before live deployment. Thus DuKong Testnet enables dApp developers to test in a realworld environment, ensuring smooth mainnet deployment. Key features include the use of the OM token, account creation, token transfers, CosmWasm for smart contract development, custom modules for RWAs, a user-friendly interface, phased validator onboarding, and community engagement through activities and incentives. DuKong comprises a distributed network of nodes using a decentralized protocol and a Proof of Stake \u0000",

      " MANTRA SMART CONTRACTS MANTRA DEX \n\n🎁 (^) Farm Manager The Farm Manager is a monolithic contract that handles all the farms-related logic for the pools. The Farm Manager has two main concepts; a Farm , containing a reward to be distributed and a Position , defined as a user's liquidity in a pool locked in the contract. Users of the Liquidity Hub, when providing liquidity, can opt to lock their LP shares which will in turn send them to the Farm Manager until they are unlocked. Creating farms is permissionless, and farms can be perpetual. This means they can be expanded forever. Anyone can create a farm by calling the ManageFarm message with the FarmAction::Fill action and paying the farm creation fee, which is sent to the Fee Collector. Users can decide to provide an identifier, which they can later use to top up or close the farm. If no identifier is provided, the contract will generate one. The farm identifiers have a prefix, if the farm is created without an identifier it will get ",
      "the prefix f, followed by a number. On the other hand, if the farm is created with a custom identifier, the prefix will be m, followed by the custom identifier provided. To top up a farm, the owner of the farm must call ManageFarm with the FarmAction::Fill action. The user must provide the identifier of the farm it intends to top up, including the prefix assigned by the contract. The farm can only be topped up with the same token as the original reward, and the amount must be a multiple of the original reward's amount. A farm is considered expired after the time defined in the contract configuration as farm_expiration_time has passed once the farm has ended. Once a farm is expired it cannot be expanded, and expired farms are closed automatically when creating new farms. \n\n## How it works \n\n### Farms \n\n#### Topping up a Farm \n\n#### Closing a Farm \n\n MANTRA Chain Search...^ Ctrl^ +^ K This site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.

      "the privacy policy. Accept Reject \n\n\nTo close a farm, the owner of the farm or the owner of the contract must call ManageFarm with the FarmAction::Close action with the identifier of the farm to be closed, including the prefix assigned by the contract. The farm will be closed, and the remaining tokens will be sent to the owner of the farm. Farm rewards are distributed every epoch, and the user can claim rewards for as long as the farm is live. Based on the parameters used when creating the farm, the rewards will get an emission rate per epoch. The emission rate is the amount of tokens distributed per epoch. The user rewards are calculated as follows: where lp are the unique LP denoms the user has locked in the contract, f are the active farms, e the epochs, ranging from the start epoch, which is either the epoch at which the farm starts, or the subsequent epoch after the user's last claimed epoch, until the current epoch which is the one at the moment the claim or query is made. ulpw i",
      "s the user's LP weight, tlpw is the total LP weight, and r is the reward allocation for a given epoch. The maximum number of concurrent farms for a given LP denom is defined when the contract is instantiated, and it is stored in the config as max_concurrent_farms. Note: If a user has pending rewards the moment a farm is closed, the user loses the possibility to claim those tokens as all unclaimed tokens are reimbursed to the farm owner. Positions can be created, expanded (topped up), or withdrawn. This is done via the ManagePosition message, followed by the desired action, i.e. PositionAction::Create , PositionAction::Expand , PositionAction::Close or PositionAction::Withdraw. When a user creates a position, it must provide an unlocking duration and an identifier (optional). The longer the unlocking duration, the higher the weight of the LP position, which equates to higher rewards. Choosing an unlocking duration of one day gives the user a multiplier of 1 x, while the maximum period o",
      "f 365 days gives the user a multiplier of 16 x. \n\n#### user rewards = ⋅ \n\n lp= a \n\n#### ∑ \n\n N denoms f = b \n\n#### ∑ \n\n N farms e =start \n\n#### ∑ \n\n current \n\n#### t lpw e \n\n#### u lpw e \n\n#### re \n\n#### Reward Distribution \n\n### Positions \n\n This site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic. By browsing this site, you accept the privacy policy. \n\n\nLike the farm identifiers, the position identifiers also get a prefix assigned by the contract. If the position is created without a custom identifier, it will get the prefix p, followed by a number. On the other hand, if the position is created with a custom identifier, the prefix will be u, followed by the custom identifier provided. The unlocking duration is the time it takes in seconds to unlock the position, which is necessary to withdraw the LP tokens from the contract. There's a limit of 100 open positions, as well as 100 closed positions per user. Note: The unlocking duration is defined as how long the user needs t",
      "o wait after hitting the Close action to be able to withdraw the LP tokens from the contract. Not to be confused with how long the LP tokens are locked in the farm. The LP tokens are locked in the farm for as long as the user has a position in the farm manager. To expand a position, the user must call ManagePosition with the PositionAction::Expand action using the position identifier of the position to expand. Expanding a position only involves adding more LP tokens to the position. The unlocking period of the original position is kept. Only open positions can be expanded. When a user creates a position, the LP tokens are locked in the contract. The user can't withdraw them until the unlocking duration is complete. The clock starts ticking the moment the user closes the position. Closing a position is done by calling ManagePosition with the PositionAction::Close action. The user must provide the identifier of the position to be closed. Once this action is triggered, the Position.open s",
      "tate is set to false, and expiring_at is set to the block height after which the position will be able to be withdrawn. It is possible to close a position partially by providing the amount of LP tokens to remove from the position. Once the unlocking duration is complete after closing a position, the user can withdraw the LP tokens from the contract by calling the ManagePosition with the PositionAction::Withdraw action. Alternatively, if the user doesn't want to wait for the unlocking duration to complete, it is \n\n#### Topping up a Position \n\n#### Closing a Position \n\n#### Withdrawing a Position \n\n This site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.

This will unlock and withdraw the position immediately, and the user will pay a penalty fee in case the unlocking period has not passed. Half of the penalty is distributed among ",
      "the farm owners of the given LP, while the other half goes to the Fee Collector. Once the user closes and withdraws the position, they receive their LP tokens back. Note: The emergency unlock feature can be used on both open and closed positions. However, if this feature is used, the user renounces all unclaimed rewards for the given position. Users can claim farm rewards from active farms for their LP tokens, only if they have a position in the farm manager. Users can only claim rewards for future epochs, i.e. after the epoch in which the position was created. Farm rewards are distributed based on the user's share of the total LP tokens in the contract. So if there's a total of 100 LP tokens in the contract, and a user has 10 LP tokens, the user will receive 10% of the rewards for that epoch, for that given farm. To claim rewards, the user must call the Claim message. Once that's done, the contract will save the epoch in which the claim was made in LAST_CLAIMED_EPOCH , and will sync t",

You will find your projected allocation on the MANTRA Zone page. USDY token distribution will be staggered based on each snapshot. The staggered manner allows you to access USDY on MANTRA Chain as early as possible while adhering to certain restrictions under U.S. securities laws, which can require Ondo to take up to 50 days to mint the USDY.

Since your validator was associated with a testnet, the tokens it was delegated have no realworld value, eliminating the need to transfer or keep any tokens from the former testnet. If you're utilizing a physical machine and prefer not to reinstall the operating system, you may bypass certain initial setup steps related to the OS. However, you will need to update two critical items to their latest versions: \n\n## • The^ mantrachaind^ binary. \n\n## • The^ genesis.json^ configuration^ file. \n\nIf you're updating an existing system, here's what you should do: \n\n1.

It helps delegators get to know who you are and why they should delegate to your validator particularly if you include your web site details. Make sure to provide input for every flag below. If a flag is not included in the command the field will default to empty ( --moniker defaults to the machine name) if the field has never been set or remain the same if it has been set in the past. The <key_name> specifies which validator you are editing. If you choose to not include some of the flags below, remember that the --from flag must be included to identify the validator to update. The --identity can be used as to verify identity with systems like Keybase or UPort. When using Keybase, --identity should be populated with a 16-digit string that is generated with a keybase.io account. It's a cryptographically secure method of ver",

Not to mention, the MANTRA Bridge is the ONLY secure way to migrate your ERC 20 OM tokens to MANTRA Chain! With that, letʼs discuss the process at a high-level. \n\n1. Ethereum side:     a.

Upon a successful EVM-wallet transaction, these ERC 20 OM tokens are then sent to the        official Ethereum burn address.     c.

      " DEVELOPING ON MANTRA CHAIN GETTING STARTED \n\n# Install Prerequisites \n\n### In this section, we will set up our machine and install the prerequisites for developing, \n\n### deploying and interacting with smart contracts on MANTRA Chain. \n\nGo You can set up Go following the official documentation. The latest versions of mantrachaind require go version v1.18\u0000. Assuming you have never worked with Rust, you will first need to install some tooling. The standard approach is to use rustup to maintain dependencies and handle updating multiple versions of cargo and rustc, which you will be using. First, install rustup. Once installed, make sure you have the wasm 32 target: wasm32-unknown-unknown states the target specification, and is called \"target triple\" consisting of three strings separated by hyphens. Strings represent architecture, vendor, and operating system respectively. unknown means there is no specifications for the target and the application is more flexible. Read the rust docs for ",

The protocol is built around singleton contracts, which makes it easier to manage and integrate with other protocols. MANTRA DEX is based on White Whale V 2. The following is the architecture of MANTRA DEX, and a general description of each contract: The direction of the arrows represents the dependencies between the contracts. The Pool Manager is the contract that manages the pools in the DEX. It is responsible for creating pool and handling swaps. Pool creation is permisionless, meaning anyone can create a pool if the fee is paid. The Pool Manager depends on the Farm Manager and the Fee Collector.

It also includes liquidity pools, where users can provide tokens to boost the ecosystemʼs liquidity. Users who are swapping their tokens will interact with the liquidity pool to exchange one token for another. The rate at which the swap is executed will be determined by the liquidity pool tokens within the pool. Liquidity pools are essential for facilitating exchange of tokens by supplying the necessary liquidity. By aggregating value into the pool, you can execute swaps instantly, while liquidity providers add their tokens to the pool. Liquidity is provided through liquidity pools, which contain a pair of tokens. You can contribute an equivalent amount of both tokens based on the exchange rate of a liquidity pool. After providing liquidity, you receive LP token",

      " APPENDIX FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS MANTRA ZONE FAQS MANTRA BRIDGE FAQS \n\n# My MANTRA Bridge order is stuck \n\n# on Ethereum?! How can I fix this? \n\nIf your MANTRA Bridge order is stuck, it may be due to a low gas fee or network congestion. You can resolve this using one of the following options: Option A\u0000 Replace-by-Fee \u0000RBF\u0000 If your wallet supports RBF (such as MetaMask or Trezor), you can speed up your stuck transaction by following these steps: \n\n1. Check Your Pending Transaction:     Open your Ethereum wallet and locate the pending transaction associated with your     MANTRA Bridge order. \n\n2. Access the RBF Feature:     In your wallet's transaction history, look for an option to \"Speed Up\" or \"Replace\" the     transaction. \n\n3. Set a Higher Gas Price:     Choose a new gas price that is higher than the original transaction. This incentivizes miners     to prioritize your new transaction. \n\n4. Confirm the Transaction:     Once you've adjusted the gas price, confirm and send the new",
      " transaction. This will replace     the original stuck transaction. Option B\u0000 Use Nonce Adjustment If RBF is not available in your wallet, you can manually adjust the nonce to unstuck your transaction: \n\n1. Identify the Stuck Transaction's Nonce:     Visit Etherscan and search for your transaction hash \u0000TXID) to find its nonce. \n\n2. Prepare a New Transaction:     Create a new transaction with a recipient address set to your own Ethereum address and an     amount of 0 ETH. Make sure to set the nonce to the same value as the stuck transaction. \n\n3. Set a Higher Gas Fee:     Choose a gas fee higher than what you set for the original transaction to incentivize miners.

      " NODE & VALIDATOR OPERATIONS \n\n# Overview \n\n## What are Validator Nodes? \n\nMANTRA Chain relies on a team of validators who are tasked with adding new blocks to the blockchain. Here's how the process works and some critical details about its structure: Validators and Consensus Protocol: Validators play a key role in the consensus protocol by casting votes, which include cryptographic signatures from their private keys. They are essentially responsible for confirming the transactions. Bonding and Delegating Network Tokens: Potential validators can bond their own tokens. Others can also stake, or 'delegate,' their tokens to these candidates. The validators are chosen based on the total number of tokens delegated to them. Earning Tokens and Transaction Fees: Both validators and their delegators earn tokens through block provisions and tokens through transaction fees. This is achieved by executing the Tendermint consensus protocol. Validators can even set a commission percentage on the fees",
      " to incentivize their delegators. Overview of Validators: You can find details about all current validators and their voting power on Mintscan. Penalties for Misconduct: If validators act inappropriately (e.g., double-signing or being offline too long), they and their delegators can face penalties. The severity of the penalty depends on the violation's seriousness. Defending Against Attacks: Validators are charged with protecting the network against denialof-service attacks. A recommended strategy is to use a 'sentry node architecture.' Sentry Node Architecture Explained: \n\n## • Validator^ nodes^ should^ only^ connect^ to^ trusted^ full-nodes. \n\n## • Typically,^ a^ validator^ node^ will^ run^ in^ a^ data^ centre,^ which^ often^ has^ direct^ links^ to^ major \n\n cloud providers. \n\n## • Validators^ can^ use^ these^ links^ to^ connect^ to^ sentry^ nodes^ in^ the^ cloud,^ shifting^ the^ burden^ of \n\n attacks to the sentry nodes. \n\n## • Sentry^ nodes^ can^ be^ quickly^ adjusted^ or^ created^",

      " NODE & VALIDATOR OPERATIONS VALIDATOR ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n# Secure Validator \n\nValidators are charged with protecting the network against denial-of-service attacks. A recommended strategy is to use a 'sentry node architecture.' Sentry nodes, also known as relay nodes or gateway nodes, are an important component in the infrastructure of a blockchain network. They serve as intermediaries between the validator nodes and the rest of the network, providing enhanced security and network efficiency. \n\n## • Validator^ nodes^ should^ only^ connect^ to^ trusted^ full-nodes. \n\n## • Typically,^ a^ validator^ node^ will^ run^ in^ a^ data^ center,^ which^ often^ has^ direct^ links^ to^ major \n\n cloud providers. \n\n## • Validators^ can^ use^ these^ links^ to^ connect^ to^ sentry^ nodes^ in^ the^ cloud,^ shifting^ the^ burden^ of \n\n attacks to the sentry nodes. \n\n## • Sentry^ nodes^ can^ be^ quickly^ adjusted^ or^ created^ to^ fend^ off^ attacks. \n\n## • The^ links^ to^ the^ sentry^ nodes^ a",
      "re^ in^ private^ IP^ space,^ protecting^ them^ from^ internet-based \n\ndisturbances. By using this architecture, validator block proposals and votes are ensured to reach the rest of the network, maintaining the stability and integrity of MANTRA Chain. Key management plays a crucial role in securing and controlling access to your accounts and assets. Some important aspects of key management are: \n\n1. Key Generation: To interact with the MANTRA network, you need a cryptographic key pair     consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key should be kept securely and     should not be shared with anyone. \n\n2. Wallets and Key Storage: Wallet applications or software provide a user-friendly interface     for managing your keys and interacting with the network. These wallets often use secure     storage mechanisms to protect your private keys, such as encrypted databases or hardware     wallets. \n\n3. Backups and Recovery: It's crucial to create backups of your private keys and st",
      "ore them     securely. Losing access to your private key can result in permanent loss of funds or assets. \n\n## Sentry Node Protection \n\n## Key Management \n\n MANTRA Chain Search...^ Ctrl^ +^ K This site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.

Key Security: Protecting your private key is paramount. Ensure that your devices, including     computers and mobile devices, are secure, updated with the latest security patches, and     free from malware or keyloggers. Be cautious when entering your private key, especially on     shared or public computers. \n\n5. Key Sharing and Delegation: In some cases, you may want to delegate your stake to a     validator or authorize someone else to manage your assets on your behalf. It's important to     exercise",
      " caution when sharing your private key or granting access to your accounts. \n\n6. Hardware Security Modules \u0000HSMs\u0000\u0000 HSMs provide dedicated hardware-based security     measures and extra layers of protection against key theft or unauthorized access. Utilizing     hardware security modules \u0000HSMs\u0000 is a key strategy in safeguarding a validator's key and     mitigating the risk of compromising the entire delegated stake, as it significantly reduces the     likelihood of an attacker successfully stealing the key.

      " USING MANTRA CHAIN \n\n# Stake \n\n## Everything you need to know about Staking on MANTRA Zone \n\nStaking is a fundamental aspect of the MANTRA Chain, serving as the backbone of its Proof of Stake \u0000PoS) consensus mechanism and ensuring the network's security, decentralization, and stability. In a PoS blockchain like MANTRA, validators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks, and they must stake a certain amount of the native token, $OM, as collateral to participate in this process. Staking is essential because it aligns the interests of validators with the health of the network; validators are incentivized to act honestly to earn rewards, while those who engage in malicious behavior risk losing their staked $OM. $OM Staking in MANTRA Zone gives crypto users the opportunity to actively participate in the network's security and stability. By staking your $OM coins, you can delegate them to trusted validators, supporting the network while earning $OM rewards in return. The pro",
      "cess is straightforward and accessible, ensuring that anyone can easily stake their coins and benefit from the rewards, all while supporting a more decentralized and secure ecosystem. Stake $OM now and start earning rewards!

      " APPENDIX FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS VALIDATOR FAQS \n\n# What are my key \n\n# responsibilities as a validator? \n\nKey responsibilities after becoming a validator include: \n\n1. Transaction validation: When a user initiates a transaction, it is broadcasted to the network     and propagated to the validator nodes. This transaction contains information such as the     sender, recipient and amount. Validators receive the transaction and validate its content. This     includes confirming that the sender has sufficient funds and the transaction is properly     signed. \n\n2. Block creation & Consensus participation: Validators participate in the consensus process,     where they collectively agree on the order and content of transactions to be included in the     next block. They propose new blocks and reach a consensus on the valid state of the     blockchain. \n\n3. Network security maintenance: This includes keeping the node software up to date,     monitoring node health and performance, managin",
      "g validator keys, and addressing any     technical issues that may arise. \n\n4. Governance Participation: Validators have a role in participating in the network's decision-     making processes. They may vote on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, or other     network proposals that impact the blockchain's operations. \n\n5. Community engagement: Validators engage with the community and network participants.     They may provide support, answer questions, and contribute to the development and growth     of the blockchain ecosystem. \n\n6. Delegator Trust: Validators often receive stake delegation from other participants in the     network. Delegators rely on validators to perform their duties reliably to secure and grow     their staked assets. Validators who consistently maintain uptime and block signing build trust     with delegators, attracting more stake and participation.        Previous What does a new validatorʼs journey look like?

      "MANTRA Chain is at the forefront of blending traditional financial markets with blockchain technology. In essence, Real World Asset \u0000RWA) tokenization promises users a compliant and frictionless method to transfer full or fractional ownership of diverse assets across various jurisdictions and blockchain ecosystems. However, in reality, there are numerous obstacles at every stage of this process from asset exchange to blockchain interoperability and jurisdictional transitions. While tokenization has long been hailed as blockchain's allure for conventional finance, the initial assumption was that banks would exclusively develop and utilize their own proprietary blockchain solutions. Traditional industries, from finance to supply chain, invested billions in developing private blockchain-based enterprise networks to facilitate seamless tokenized value exchange between pre-approved intermediaries. The concept was that launching these sophisticated, albeit closed, digital networks would some",
      "how invigorate traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, equities, debentures, commodities, or art. However, closed networks remain inherently limited, and permissioned networks have yet to achieve critical mass. Current evidence suggests they may never do so in their present form. “Permissionless blockchain for permissioned applications” MANTRA Chain offers an innovative solution: a permissionless environment where permissioned applications can flourish. Instead of embedding compliance at the consensus level, smart contract modules enable flexible, robust permissioning at the application layer as needed.

    "13) So just to conclude, I think from our perspective KBW was a massive success, and I’m excited to be back again next year. Korea is such a vibrant market, and with commitment to learn the nuances, meet the key players, and take it seriously, it can deliver outsized results.",
    "12) You just have to find another gear. Similar to fundraising, you need to give 100% to your normal job/responsibilities, and find another +20% to the other tasks (conferences, fundraising, etc.). I know this isn’t easy, and comes with trade offs. In my case, sleep/health… 😴",
    "11) Right now we’re in the middle of the road to Mainnet (later this fall) and being top of mind as an RWA &amp; L1 leader is critically important. However, that also means my “normal” job of keeping the business on track and running optimally doesn’t just go away.",
    "10) As a founder, the opportunity cost of time spent on less important things is SIGNIFICANT. So was my time at KBW worth it? Yes. That being said, this needs a bit of context to paint the full picture.",
    "9) Once again, this isn’t the easiest thing to measure, but in my estimation we made several key new partner/investor relationships, laid the ground work for a massive new RWA deal, and (completely randomly) secured a massive TVL commitment. Well worth it. 🫡",
    "8) Story was everywhere this week, so piggybacking off their marketing/branding machine made sense. Congrats to      &amp; the team for absolutely crushing it this week!🫡 Would highly recommend this strategy to smaller teams.",
    "7) Just connecting with the  homies in a more significant way made it worth it… can you say IP RWAs incoming? ꧁🕉️꧂ But adding on the fireside chat with  and being able to speak about our upcoming Mainnet launch was icing on the cake! 🍰",
    "6) Another example was The  House (side event). Imo this was one of the best run and coolest events of the week. We were one of the bigger sponsors, but were able to leverage this sponsorship to meet with industry leaders/investors, and share new RWA use cases.",
    "5) Now don’t get me wrong, it still cost money, and expecting a brand new project with possibly less treasury/funds to achieve similar results isn’t what I’m saying. You have to do what’s best for your project. There’s no one-size fits all, however this did work for us.🫡🕉️💧",
    "4) While it’s impossible to know exactly the reach here, literally everyone drinks water, and you could see 10k attendees carrying them around the event nonstop. Combined with a speaking opp + our mini viral moment, it was money well spent imo.",
    "3) One example was the water sponsorship at  I had messages from people who weren’t even at the conference hearing about the MANTRA water 🕉️💧. It was one of the cheaper sponsorships, and we had like a mini viral moment by bringing that liquidity 🫡",
    "2) IMO, spending money for conferences or side events ISN’T the issue. It’s not knowing what results you’re getting. This year at MANTRA if we don’t have a major release, we are taking the “spend as little as possible to still get a speaking slot/optimize for brand awareness”",
    "1) The allure of being a “conference sponsor” is real. The idea of “look at all the brand visibility we’ll get” is something conferences push on sponsors, but in reality, most times the money isn’t well spent, and almost always not tracked.",

    "11) Nothing less than turning MANTRA into an “institution” will be acceptable in my mind. That being said we won’t be a stodgy institution from the past, we will be a new age institution. Built for “our people” and by “our people”.",
    "10) It also led me to be just a bit more intense at the office when I’m there (sorry not sorry team) 😂 In the end of the day, this intensity stems from my care for MANTRA, our people, our community, and my conviction in what we’re building.",

    "7) That being said, I can see that from particular vantage points, this perception of “nice” can sometimes seem as a lack of fairness when it’s played out in different scenarios.",
    "6) I think a common theme people in the team would say about me is that I’m “too nice” sometimes. I’ve thought about this A LOT. I agree that I’m a nice guy, but at the same time, I think context is crucial here. Being “too nice” ≠ lack of standards or accountability.",
    "5) Have a think about that. Why tf would you spend time giving critical feedback to someone you didn’t actually care about, want to support/help, and want to grow together with? You wouldn’t. Period.",
    "4) The idea of feedback and accountability is one I want to double click on and spend some more time unpacking. My father once told me that by holding people accountable for their actions, even if the conversations are difficult it actually shows more care than by not doing it.",
    "3) Together with our team, we have created a value set predicated on hard work, open feedback, being accountable, respect for our peers, being open to make mistakes and try new things, iterating fast, and a desire for growth. These are all things 100% aligned with my value set.",
    "2) The success of any business is built off the strength of its people. Cultivating a strong culture is paramount. As a founder, creating, communicating, and most importantly LIVING your cultural values day in and day out is arguably your most important task.",
    "1) To begin, I just want to say I don’t take any of this “success” for granted. Crypto is easy come, easy go. Sustained value creation is how you win long term. As a wise man once told me, stay humble, stay hungry. And we’re hungrier than ever…",

    "10) Before jumping on the new token hype cycle, make sure you know what you're investing in. DYOR is important—Now more than ever. $OM 🕉️",
    "9) Strong tokenomics are as important as innovative products in web3. This recent  report spotlighting this is good. Retail needs to know what they are buying.",
    "8) MANTRA's tokenomics are well-structured to support community members and retail investors, preventing an unbalanced market structure that could be problematic for future unlocks. We've always prioritized protecting our users' interests and will ALWAYS continue to do so.",
    "7) MANTRA was born in HK around the same time FTX was coming up, and we saw firsthand how SBF popularized the low-float/high FDV launch. Whether through outright theft or this mechanism, he absolutely REKT his community and users. Why is it even still around?",
    "6) At MANTRA we still believe in that. I thought everything we went through as an industry from 2018-2023 was to get rid of the platforms that traded against you and the guys who would outright steal your money.",
    "5) If projects start treating retail the same way the old regime did, where is the ideological edge? Wasn’t the entire point of crypto, at least to some degree, about financial sovereignty and a level playing field for investing in frontier tech? Can we make ICOs great again?🤔",
    "4) People have to be able to make money after all, and as much as building amazing tech is the name of the game, investor interest, ESPECIALLY retail interest, is fickle. Too many projects are thinking about short-term mindshare. The token is a product after all innit?",
    "3) But I do want to say this: the recent launch meta of low float, extremely high FDV launches has impacted confidence among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts to a degree I’ve never seen before, and not without reason.",
    "2) MANTRA has been in this space for a while. And we’ve seen all kinds of launches, snowballs of hopium that crash then crater, peak-bull pump &amp; dumps—all kinds of stuff. I honestly don’t wanna even talk about it all (at least not in this thread... separate thread, anyone?)",
    "1) As mentioned, &gt;90% of the $OM supply is already distributed, and that value will be around ~50% at mainnet genesis block. A SIGNIFICANT part of this goes to community allocations, leaving a 7-10x bigger float than most new L1s. This is VERY intentional.",
    "So I feel like with the current low float, high FDV meta going around here's my mandatory tweet about how &gt;90% $OM supply is already distributed, but ALSO some thoughts on longevity, tokenomics and building for legacy vs pump and dumps. A thread 🧵👇",
